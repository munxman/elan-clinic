          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Weight loss is difficult because the body actively resists it. When you lose weight, your metabolism slows down, hunger hormones increase, and satiety hormones decrease — a coordinated biological response designed to protect you from starvation. These adaptations can persist for years after weight loss, making it extremely hard to maintain results through willpower alone. This is why obesity is classified as a chronic disease, not a character flaw."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Obesity has many overlapping causes: genetics account for 40–70% of weight predisposition, but environment, hormones, sleep quality, stress, medications, and gut microbiome all play significant roles. Processed foods engineered for overconsumption, sedentary lifestyles, and chronic stress create conditions where weight gain is almost inevitable for biologically susceptible individuals. Blaming willpower misses the full picture."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both are typically defined using Body Mass Index (BMI). Overweight is a BMI of 25–29.9; obesity starts at 30. Obesity is further divided into Class I (30–34.9), Class II (35–39.9), and Class III (40+). However, BMI is an imperfect tool — it does not measure body fat distribution or metabolic health. Waist circumference and metabolic markers like blood sugar and blood pressure often tell a more complete story."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A widely accepted safe rate is 0.5–1 kg per week, which corresponds to a daily calorie deficit of roughly 500–1,000 kcal. Faster loss is sometimes appropriate under medical supervision — for example, before surgery — but it increases the risk of muscle loss, gallstones, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic slowdown. Sustainable, medically guided weight loss prioritises preserving lean mass and long-term results over speed."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Weight regain after dieting is biologically driven, not a failure of motivation. Losing weight triggers hormonal changes — including lower leptin and higher ghrelin — that increase hunger and reduce the amount of energy your body burns at rest. These changes can persist for a long time. Without addressing the underlying biology, most people regain the majority of lost weight within one to five years. This is why a comprehensive plan — including behavioural, medical, and lifestyle elements — produces far better long-term outcomes than dieting alone."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Even a 5–10% reduction in body weight produces meaningful health improvements: blood pressure drops, blood sugar and insulin sensitivity improve, LDL cholesterol decreases, and joint pain often lessens. Sleep apnoea may resolve or improve significantly. Beyond the numbers, people frequently report more energy, better mood, and improved mobility. Larger reductions — 15–20% or more — can put type 2 diabetes into remission and substantially reduce cardiovascular risk."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The most effective diet is the one a person can sustain. Research comparing low-carb, low-fat, Mediterranean, and intermittent fasting diets consistently shows that long-term adherence matters far more than the specific dietary pattern. All approaches that create a calorie deficit work; none is dramatically superior in the long run. The ideal eating plan is built around whole foods, adequate protein to preserve muscle, and a structure that fits real life — not one borrowed from a celebrity."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How important is physical activity for weight loss?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Exercise is important, but perhaps not for the reason most people think. Physical activity contributes only modestly to initial weight loss because it is difficult to out-exercise a poor diet. Where exercise becomes critical is in weight maintenance: people who keep weight off long-term almost universally incorporate regular movement. Strength training is especially valuable because it preserves muscle mass during calorie restriction, which protects metabolic rate and functional strength."

        "name": "Is intermittent fasting effective for weight loss?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Intermittent fasting — eating within a defined window each day — can be an effective strategy for some people, primarily because it makes it easier to consume fewer calories. Current evidence suggests it produces results roughly comparable to continuous calorie restriction. It may also have metabolic benefits beyond calorie reduction, though research on this is still developing. For people who find it easier to skip a meal than to count calories, it can be a practical and sustainable approach."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No. Carbohydrates are not inherently fattening. Weight loss depends on overall energy balance, not on avoiding any single macronutrient. Low-carbohydrate diets can be effective — partly because protein and fat tend to be more satiating — but they are not necessary. What matters more is the quality and quantity of food overall: minimising ultra-processed foods, eating adequate protein, and consuming a reasonable total amount of calories."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both have a significant and often underestimated impact. Poor sleep — fewer than 7 hours per night — raises ghrelin (the hunger hormone), lowers leptin (the satiety hormone), increases cravings for calorie-dense foods, and impairs insulin sensitivity. Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which promotes fat storage particularly around the abdomen. Addressing sleep quality and stress management is not optional for sustainable weight management — they are foundational."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The overwhelming majority of weight-loss supplements lack credible clinical evidence. Those that show any effect — such as caffeine or green tea extract — produce minimal results that rarely justify the cost or potential side effects. Many 'fat burner' products are unregulated, and some contain stimulants or other substances with real safety risks. There is no supplement that substitutes for a sustainable eating pattern, movement, and — where appropriate — evidence-based medical treatment."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) are gut hormones that regulate appetite, insulin release, and gastric emptying. Synthetic analogues — such as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) — mimic these hormones, reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness, and slowing the rate at which food leaves the stomach. The result is a significant, sustained reduction in calorie intake. These are the most effective medications currently available for weight management."

        "name": "How effective are weight-loss medications?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Modern GLP-1 medications represent a significant advance over earlier obesity treatments. Clinical trials of semaglutide show average weight loss of 15–17% of body weight over 68 weeks. Tirzepatide (dual GLP-1/GIP agonist) achieves 20–22% in trials — comparable in some cases to bariatric surgery outcomes. Older medications like orlistat are considerably less effective. Results vary between individuals, and medications work best as part of a comprehensive programme including lifestyle support."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Current clinical guidelines indicate GLP-1 medications for adults with a BMI of 30 or above, or a BMI of 27 or above in the presence of a weight-related health condition such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnoea. Prescribing decisions are always individual — taking into account medical history, current medications, contraindications, and a person's own goals and preferences. A thorough medical assessment is the essential first step."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "GLP-1 medications have a well-established safety profile from large clinical trials and years of use in diabetes management. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal — nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhoea — particularly when starting treatment or increasing the dose. These typically improve over time. More serious but rare risks include pancreatitis and, in people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a theoretical thyroid risk. A detailed medical history is essential before prescribing."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For many people, ongoing treatment is necessary to maintain results — because the underlying biological drive to regain weight does not disappear. When GLP-1 medications are stopped, hunger hormones return to pre-treatment levels and weight typically begins to return within months. This does not mean everyone needs to stay on medication indefinitely; some people make lasting lifestyle changes that support weight maintenance off medication. The decision is made jointly and reviewed regularly throughout care."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Beyond GLP-1 and GIP analogues, other approved options include orlistat (a fat absorption inhibitor), naltrexone/bupropion (a combination affecting appetite pathways), and older medications with more limited use profiles. Newer agents in development target additional hormonal pathways and may offer further advances in coming years. The right choice depends on an individual's specific health profile, other medications, and treatment goals — a decision best made with an experienced clinician."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Bariatric surgery refers to procedures that alter the anatomy of the digestive system to reduce food intake, nutrient absorption, or both. The most common types are sleeve gastrectomy (removing part of the stomach) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Surgery is generally considered for adults with a BMI above 40, or above 35 with serious weight-related health conditions, when sustained non-surgical approaches have not achieved adequate results. It produces the largest and most durable weight loss currently available, but carries surgical risks and requires lifelong follow-up."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Bariatric surgery can be psychologically complex. Rates of depression and anxiety can be elevated in the post-operative period, and some people experience difficulty adjusting to their changed body and eating habits. Pre-existing mental health conditions require careful assessment before surgery. Psychological support — both before and after the procedure — significantly improves long-term outcomes. It is important to understand that surgery changes the body, not the mind: unresolved emotional relationships with food may persist or shift in form after the procedure."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Does the risk of alcohol misuse increase after bariatric surgery?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes — this is a well-documented risk, particularly after gastric bypass. Following surgery, alcohol is absorbed more rapidly and reaches higher blood concentrations than before the procedure. This changes the subjective experience of drinking and increases vulnerability to alcohol use disorder. Studies suggest the risk is highest two to five years post-surgery, and the problem is often underappreciated in pre-surgical counselling. Awareness, monitoring, and support are an important part of post-operative care."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How often does weight regain occur after bariatric surgery?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Some degree of weight regain is common. On average, people regain 20–30% of the weight they lost within five years, though outcomes vary considerably. Factors include the type of procedure, adherence to post-operative lifestyle guidance, psychological factors, and metabolic adaptation. Clinically significant regain — returning to near pre-surgical weight — occurs in a meaningful proportion of people without ongoing support. This is precisely why structured long-term follow-up matters so much."

Post-surgical follow-up at Élan includes medical review, nutritional guidance, and ongoing support to help people sustain the benefits of surgery long-term.

We take a detailed medical history, discuss your weight history and previous attempts, review relevant lab results or arrange new ones, and assess any current medications and health conditions. There is no judgement — only a thorough, honest conversation. By the end of the visit, you will have a clear understanding of your options and, if appropriate, a concrete plan. Most people leave feeling that someone has finally taken their situation seriously."

            <span class="faq-question">Why is weight loss so difficult?</span>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Weight loss is difficult because the body actively resists it. When you lose weight, your metabolism slows down, hunger hormones increase, and satiety hormones decrease — a coordinated biological response designed to protect you from starvation. These adaptations can persist for years after weight loss, making it extremely hard to maintain results through willpower alone. This is why obesity is classified as a chronic disease, not a character flaw.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Obesity has many overlapping causes: genetics account for 40–70% of weight predisposition, but environment, hormones, sleep quality, stress, medications, and gut microbiome all play significant roles. Processed foods engineered for overconsumption, sedentary lifestyles, and chronic stress create conditions where weight gain is almost inevitable for biologically susceptible individuals. Blaming willpower misses the full picture.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Both are typically defined using Body Mass Index (BMI). Overweight is a BMI of 25–29.9; obesity starts at 30. Obesity is further divided into Class I (30–34.9), Class II (35–39.9), and Class III (40+). However, BMI is an imperfect tool — it does not measure body fat distribution or metabolic health. Waist circumference and metabolic markers like blood sugar and blood pressure often tell a more complete story.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A widely accepted safe rate is 0.5–1 kg per week, which corresponds to a daily calorie deficit of roughly 500–1,000 kcal. Faster loss is sometimes appropriate under medical supervision — for example, before surgery — but it increases the risk of muscle loss, gallstones, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic slowdown. Sustainable, medically guided weight loss prioritises preserving lean mass and long-term results over speed.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Weight regain after dieting is biologically driven, not a failure of motivation. Losing weight triggers hormonal changes — including lower leptin and higher ghrelin — that increase hunger and reduce the amount of energy your body burns at rest. These changes can persist for a long time. Without addressing the underlying biology, most people regain the majority of lost weight within one to five years. This is why a comprehensive plan — including behavioural, medical, and lifestyle elements — produces far better long-term outcomes than dieting alone.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Even a 5–10% reduction in body weight produces meaningful health improvements: blood pressure drops, blood sugar and insulin sensitivity improve, LDL cholesterol decreases, and joint pain often lessens. Sleep apnoea may resolve or improve significantly. Beyond the numbers, people frequently report more energy, better mood, and improved mobility. Larger reductions — 15–20% or more — can put type 2 diabetes into remission and substantially reduce cardiovascular risk.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The most effective diet is the one a person can sustain. Research comparing low-carb, low-fat, Mediterranean, and intermittent fasting diets consistently shows that long-term adherence matters far more than the specific dietary pattern. All approaches that create a calorie deficit work; none is dramatically superior in the long run. The ideal eating plan is built around whole foods, adequate protein to preserve muscle, and a structure that fits real life — not one borrowed from a celebrity.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Exercise is important, but perhaps not for the reason most people think. Physical activity contributes only modestly to initial weight loss because it is difficult to out-exercise a poor diet. Where exercise becomes critical is in weight maintenance: people who keep weight off long-term almost universally incorporate regular movement. Strength training is especially valuable because it preserves muscle mass during calorie restriction, which protects metabolic rate and functional strength.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Intermittent fasting — eating within a defined window each day — can be an effective strategy for some people, primarily because it makes it easier to consume fewer calories. Current evidence suggests it produces results roughly comparable to continuous calorie restriction. It may also have metabolic benefits beyond calorie reduction, though research on this is still developing. For people who find it easier to skip a meal than to count calories, it can be a practical and sustainable approach.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. Carbohydrates are not inherently fattening. Weight loss depends on overall energy balance, not on avoiding any single macronutrient. Low-carbohydrate diets can be effective — partly because protein and fat tend to be more satiating — but they are not necessary. What matters more is the quality and quantity of food overall: minimising ultra-processed foods, eating adequate protein, and consuming a reasonable total amount of calories.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Both have a significant and often underestimated impact. Poor sleep — fewer than 7 hours per night — raises ghrelin (the hunger hormone), lowers leptin (the satiety hormone), increases cravings for calorie-dense foods, and impairs insulin sensitivity. Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which promotes fat storage particularly around the abdomen. Addressing sleep quality and stress management is not optional for sustainable weight management — they are foundational.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The overwhelming majority of weight-loss supplements lack credible clinical evidence. Those that show any effect — such as caffeine or green tea extract — produce minimal results that rarely justify the cost or potential side effects. Many 'fat burner' products are unregulated, and some contain stimulants or other substances with real safety risks. There is no supplement that substitutes for a sustainable eating pattern, movement, and — where appropriate — evidence-based medical treatment.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) are gut hormones that regulate appetite, insulin release, and gastric emptying. Synthetic analogues — such as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) — mimic these hormones, reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness, and slowing the rate at which food leaves the stomach. The result is a significant, sustained reduction in calorie intake. These are the most effective medications currently available for weight management.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Modern GLP-1 medications represent a significant advance over earlier obesity treatments. Clinical trials of semaglutide show average weight loss of 15–17% of body weight over 68 weeks. Tirzepatide (dual GLP-1/GIP agonist) achieves 20–22% in trials — comparable in some cases to bariatric surgery outcomes. Older medications like orlistat are considerably less effective. Results vary between individuals, and medications work best as part of a comprehensive programme including lifestyle support.</p>

            <p>Current clinical guidelines indicate GLP-1 medications for adults with a BMI of 30 or above, or a BMI of 27 or above in the presence of a weight-related health condition such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnoea. Prescribing decisions are always individual — taking into account medical history, current medications, contraindications, and a person's own goals and preferences.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>GLP-1 medications have a well-established safety profile from large clinical trials and years of use in diabetes management. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal — nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhoea — particularly when starting treatment or increasing the dose. These typically improve over time. More serious but rare risks include pancreatitis and, in people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a theoretical thyroid risk. A detailed medical history is essential before prescribing.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>For many people, ongoing treatment is necessary to maintain results — because the underlying biological drive to regain weight does not disappear. When GLP-1 medications are stopped, hunger hormones return to pre-treatment levels and weight typically begins to return within months. This does not mean everyone needs to stay on medication indefinitely; some people make lasting lifestyle changes that support weight maintenance off medication. The decision is made jointly and reviewed regularly throughout care.</p>

The most common types are sleeve gastrectomy (removing part of the stomach) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Surgery is generally considered for adults with a BMI above 40, or above 35 with serious weight-related health conditions, when sustained non-surgical approaches have not achieved adequate results.

            <p>Bariatric surgery can be psychologically complex. Rates of depression and anxiety can be elevated in the post-operative period, and some people experience difficulty adjusting to their changed body and eating habits. Pre-existing mental health conditions require careful assessment before surgery. Psychological support — both before and after the procedure — significantly improves long-term outcomes. It is important to understand that surgery changes the body, not the mind: unresolved emotional relationships with food may persist or shift in form after the procedure.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes — this is a well-documented risk, particularly after gastric bypass. Following surgery, alcohol is absorbed more rapidly and reaches higher blood concentrations than before the procedure. This changes the subjective experience of drinking and increases vulnerability to alcohol use disorder. Studies suggest the risk is highest two to five years post-surgery, and the problem is often underappreciated in pre-surgical counselling. Awareness, monitoring, and support are an important part of post-operative care.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Some degree of weight regain is common. On average, people regain 20–30% of the weight they lost within five years, though outcomes vary considerably. Factors include the type of procedure, adherence to post-operative lifestyle guidance, psychological factors, and metabolic adaptation. Clinically significant regain — returning to near pre-surgical weight — occurs in a meaningful proportion of people without ongoing support. This is precisely why structured long-term follow-up matters so much.</p>
